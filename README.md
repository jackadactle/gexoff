# Gexoff


Gexoff is a game about Gex the Gecko that my friend and I were making. It died a long time ago. It was supposed to be an online multiplayer game and it ended up dying in the middle of creating the menu system. My friend would come up with ideas for it and I would implement them, so I never really understood what this game was supposed to be about.
